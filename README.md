Sentiment Analysis and Correlation

## Goal

Explore two different datasets and see if there are any correlations between the data. For this project I am going to compare the national GDP growth rate with the positivity of presidential speeches.

### Part 1 - Learning some NLP

In a [Jupyter Notebook](./learn/Twitter%20Sentiment%20Analysis.ipynb), following a [Twitter Sentiment Analysis Tutorial](http://www.thegrammarlab.com/?nor-portfolio=corpus-of-presidential-speeches-cops-and-a-clintontrump-corpus) I try to gain some Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) experience.

After finishing the tutorial it seems that simply using [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/) or [VADER-Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) would be a better option.

In a [quick test](./learn/TextBlob_VADER_test.ipynb), I have decided to move forward using VADER Sentiment Analysis.

### Part 2 - Final Project
