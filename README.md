Sentiment Analysis and Correlation

## Goal

The goal of the project other than to meet class requirements, is to learn a bit more about sentiment analysis. Then take that skill and apply it to a couple datasets and examine any correlations. The initial thought is to analyses presidential speeches and the see if any correlation appears with an economic dataset.

### Part 1 - Learning some NLP
