Sentiment Analysis and Correlation

## Goal

The goal of the project other than to meet class requirements, is to learn a bit more about sentiment analysis. Then take that skill and apply it to a couple datasets and examine any correlations. The initial thought is to analyses presidential speeches and the see if any correlation appears with an economic dataset.

### Part 1 - Learning some NLP

In a [Jupyter Notebook](./learn/Twitter%20Sentiment%20Analysis.ipynb), following a [Twitter Sentiment Analysis Tutorial](http://www.thegrammarlab.com/?nor-portfolio=corpus-of-presidential-speeches-cops-and-a-clintontrump-corpus) I try to gain some Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) experience.

After finishing the tutorial it seems simply using [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/) or [VADER-Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) would be a better option.
